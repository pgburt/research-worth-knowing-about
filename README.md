"You are a good drawer" vs "You did a good drawing". More specific praise is better psychologically. When the generic case receives criticism, it affects self-worth.

### [Brain Points: A Growth Mindset Incentive Structure Boosts Persistence in an Educational Game](https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/brainpoints_chi.pdf)
"Praising a student’s inherent ability has been shown to promote the fixed mindset, or the belief that intelligence is unchangeable, while praising a student’s strategies or effort promotes the growth mindset, or the belief that intelligence is malleable"

### [Implicit Theories About Willpower Predict Self-Regulation and Grades](https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Implicit%20Theories%20about%20Willpower%20Predict%20Self%20Regulation%20and%20Grades%20in%20Everyday%20_Job%20et%20al%202015%20.pdf)
