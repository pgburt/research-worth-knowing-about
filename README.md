I wonder if it's worth tracking academic papers that are also highly accessible to the common reader?

## Carol Dweck

### [Subtle Linguistic Cues Affect Children’s Motivation](https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Suble%20linguistic%20cues%20impact%20children's%20motivation_0.pdf)
"You are a good drawer" vs "You did a good drawing". More specific praise is better psychologically. When the generic case receives criticism, it affects self-worth.

### [Brain Points: A Growth Mindset Incentive Structure Boosts Persistence in an Educational Game](https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/brainpoints_chi.pdf)
> Praising a student’s inherent ability has been shown to promote the fixed mindset, or the belief that intelligence is unchangeable, while praising a student’s strategies or effort promotes the growth mindset, or the belief that intelligence is malleable.

### [Implicit Theories About Willpower Predict Self-Regulation and Grades](https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Implicit%20Theories%20about%20Willpower%20Predict%20Self%20Regulation%20and%20Grades%20in%20Everyday%20_Job%20et%20al%202015%20.pdf)
Believe you have will power, and you will have more will power.

> It is thus well documented that self-control often suffers when self-control demands are high, both in laboratory and in everyday life settings.

> We show four primary empirical results. First, for differentiated products like wines, lowering the cost of search for quality information reduced price sensitivity.

>Second, pricesensitivity for wines common to both stores increased whencross-store comparison was made easy, as many analystshave assumed. However, easy cross-store comparison hadno effect on price sensitivity for unique wines."

>Third, makinginformation environments more transparent by lowering allthree search costs produced welfare gains for consumers.They liked the shopping experience more, selected winesthey liked more in subsequent tasting, and their retentionprobability was higher when they were contacted twomonths later and invited to continue using the electronicshopping service from home.

>Fourth, we examined the implicationsof these results for manufacturers and examinedhow market shares of wines sold by two stores or one wereaffected by search costs. When store comparison was diffi-cult, results showed that the market share of common wineswas proportional to share of distribution; but when storecomparison was made easy, the market share returns to distributiondecreased significantly. All these results suggestincentives for retailers carrying differentiated goods tomake information environments maximally transparent, butto avoid price competition by carrying more uniquemerchandise."
